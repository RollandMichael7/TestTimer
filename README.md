# TestTimer
A web-tool for timing test-taking or studying. The user inputs the number of questions and time limit (in minutes) of a given test. The
tool calculates the amount of seconds per question (assuming all take the same amount of time), and begins ticking down. When a question
is answered, the amount of time left over (or the defecit of time gone over) is added to the amount of time left. Also has capability for
pausing/resuming, resetting with new input, and displays the amount of time left (positive or negative) once all questions have been 
answered. Written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
